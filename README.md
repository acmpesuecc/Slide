# Slide

Welcome to Slide! A fun, interactive 2D tile puzzle game where the tiles are given to you in a random order and you're expected to arrange it in ascending order using your arrow keys or by using your mouse. The game is designed to look as minimalistic and user friendly as possible to suit all age groups

## How does a slide puzzle work?!

Most sliding puzzles are two-dimensional. The pieces cannot be lifted out of the frame or rearranged in any way, except by sliding them into an empty space. They are also called sliding-block puzzles or simply sliders. The goal of a sliding puzzle is to arrange the pieces in a particular pattern.
Have fun :)
